# react-contex-api
The React Context API has been around as an experimental feature for a while now, but only in React’s version 16.3.0 did it become safe to use in production. The article below will show you two basic web store apps, one built with the Context API and one without it.  This new API solves one major problem–prop drilling. Even if you’re not familiar with the term, if you’ve worked on a React.js app, it has probably happened to you. Prop drilling is the processing of getting data from component A to component Z by passing it through multiple layers of intermediary React components. Component will receive props indirectly and you, the React Developer will have to ensure everything works out right.
